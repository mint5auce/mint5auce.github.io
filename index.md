Hello. I'm Jon Hadley, a Bristol based team lead with over twenty years commercial experience in the technology industry. 

Over the last decade I've managed software development teams working on web applications, embedded systems and electronic design. I've also conducted WCAG & BS8878 compliant accessibility audits for a range of organisations.

I consider myself platform agnostic, commercially aware and equally comfortable communicating with colleagues, stakeholders, suppliers and clients.

Some key past roles include working with top UK charities as Head of Technology at [Positive](http://positivestudio.co.uk) and web production and IT support at multi Academy Award wining [Aardman Animations](http://www.aardman.com/).

Man of science, more or less agog.
