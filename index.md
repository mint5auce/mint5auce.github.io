Developer and technologist with over 15 years experience in the web and film industries.

I currently head the New Product Development team at [Lobster Pictures](http://www.lobsterpictures.tv/), bringing innovative ideas to life across a variety of cameras, hardware and software. We're also responsible for keeping our world-wide mission-critical systems and infrastructure online 24/7.
