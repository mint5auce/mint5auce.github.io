Hello. I'm Jon Hadley, a UK based technology team lead. 

Over the last twenty years I've managed software development teams working on web applications, embedded systems and electronic design. I've also conducted WCAG & BS8878 compliant accessibility audits for a range of organisations.

I consider myself platform agnostic, commercially aware and equally comfortable communicating with colleagues, stakeholders, suppliers and clients.

Some key past roles include Technical Lead at [Lobster Pictures](http://lobsterpictures.tv) and web production at multi Academy Award wining [Aardman Animations](http://www.aardman.com/).

Man of science, more or less agog.
